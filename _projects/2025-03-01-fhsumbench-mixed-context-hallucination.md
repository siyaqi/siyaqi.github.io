## Project Overview

FHSumBench is a research project focused on evaluating how large language models assess mixed-context hallucination through summarization tasks. The project provides a novel framework for understanding LLMs' self-assessment capabilities and their limitations in detecting hallucination patterns.

## Research Focus

### Mixed-Context Analysis
- **Conflicting Information**: Evaluates how LLMs handle scenarios with contradictory information in source materials
