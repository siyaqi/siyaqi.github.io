## Project Overview

SAPGraph is a novel approach for structure-aware extractive summarization of scientific papers using heterogeneous graph neural networks. The project addresses the challenge of capturing complex structural relationships in scientific documents to improve summarization quality.

## Key Contributions

- **Heterogeneous Graph Construction**: Developed methods to represent scientific papers as heterogeneous graphs
- **Structure-aware Extraction**: Created algorithms that leverage document structure for better summary generation
- **Graph Neural Network Architecture**: Designed specialized GNN models for scientific document processing

## Technical Approach

The project uses:
- **Graph Representation**: Converting scientific papers into heterogeneous graphs with different node types
- **Neural Processing**: Applying graph neural networks to capture structural relationships
- **Extractive Summarization**: Selecting key sentences based on graph structure and content

## Results

- Published at AACL 2022 conference
- Demonstrated improved performance over baseline summarization methods
- Successfully captured structural information from scientific documents

## Technologies Used

- PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric
- Graph Neural Networks
- Natural Language Processing
- Scientific document processing tools

## Project Status

**Completed** - Successfully published and contributed to the field of scientific document summarization.
