## Project Overview

Awesome-Hallu-Eval is a comprehensive collection of hallucination evaluation methods designed to assess model hallucination in language models. This repository serves as a go-to resource for researchers and practitioners working on hallucination detection and evaluation.

## Key Features

### Comprehensive Coverage
- **Before LLM Era**: Traditional evaluation methods for hallucination detection
- **After LLM Era**: Modern approaches specifically designed for large language models
- **Multi-Domain**: Covers summarization, question answering, dialogue generation, and more

### Categorized Methods
- **Source-Free (SF)**: Methods that don't require source documents
- **With-Fact (WF)**: Methods that use factual information for evaluation
- **Hybrid Approaches**: Methods that combine multiple evaluation strategies

### Detailed Documentation
