Now I am a Ph.D. student in King's College London (2023-Present), under the supervisor of [Dr. Lin Gui](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/lin-gui), [Dr. Zheng Yuan](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~zy249/), and [Prof. Yulan He](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/yulan-he).

## Research Interests

My research focuses on Natural Language Processing, particularly in the following areas:

- **LLM Hallucination Detection and Evaluation**: Developing methods to detect, evaluate, and mitigate hallucination in large language models
- **Text Summarization**: Both extractive and abstractive summarization, with special focus on scientific document summarization
- **Graph Modeling**: Leveraging graph neural networks for structured text understanding
- **Theory of Mind in AI**: Enhancing language models' reasoning capabilities about mental states
- **Cross-linguistic AI**: Understanding and improving AI systems' performance across different languages

## Education

- **PhD** in Natural Language Processing, King's College London, 2023-Present
- **Master's** in Intelligence Science and Technology, Beijing University of Post and Telecommunications (北京邮电大学), 2020-2023
- **Bachelor's** in Intelligence Science and Technology, Beijing University of Post and Telecommunications (北京邮电大学), 2016-2020

## Experience
