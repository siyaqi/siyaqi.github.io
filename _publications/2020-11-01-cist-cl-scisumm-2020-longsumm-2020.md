This paper presents our participation in the CL-SciSumm 2020 and LongSumm 2020 shared tasks. We developed automatic scientific document summarization systems that participated in both competitions, focusing on extracting and generating summaries from scientific papers.

The work addresses the challenges of automatic summarization for scientific documents, including the complexity of technical content and the need for accurate information extraction from structured academic papers.
