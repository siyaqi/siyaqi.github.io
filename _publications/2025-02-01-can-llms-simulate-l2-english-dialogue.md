This paper investigates whether large language models can effectively simulate L2-English dialogue and analyzes L1-dependent biases using information-theoretic approaches. We examine how different first languages influence the quality and authenticity of simulated second-language conversations.

The research provides insights into the challenges of cross-linguistic dialogue simulation and contributes to understanding language transfer effects in AI systems.
