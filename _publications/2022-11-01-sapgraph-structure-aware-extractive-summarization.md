This paper introduces SAPGraph, a novel approach for structure-aware extractive summarization of scientific papers using heterogeneous graph neural networks. The method leverages the structural information inherent in scientific documents to improve summarization quality.

The work demonstrates how graph-based representations can capture the complex relationships between different sections of scientific papers, leading to more coherent and informative summaries.
